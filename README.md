## Build

TODO (sorry for my laziness).

See [Dockerfile](https://github.com/bczhc/rime-android/blob/master/Dockerfile).

For the build of librime, please refer to this [gist](https://gist.github.com/bczhc/cd271734f812f32b4c9c70c766f1c95f).

## Known Issues
- May crash at specific scenarios. (more like a lack of error handling etc. Not that serious, or I'll fix it...)
- Candidates won't show on Android14. (I tested Xiaomi 14 Pro). ðŸ¤¬

Note this app is developed only for my personal use. I've tried Trime or other Android distributions for Rime (like "ä¸­æ–‡è¾“å…¥æ³•"),
however they all behave differently as I expected, plus, randomly crash etc. Yea I may misconfigured the config files
and missed some specific configs for these Android Rime clients, but
for me, I only input via physical keyboards on Android,
and I hope it uses exactly the same config as what my fcitx5-rime uses - thus my idea is to keep
it as simple as possible.

BTW in the early days,
I developed an independent [IME](https://github.com/bczhc/some-tools/tree/351efade50f2a3dc9c2b9d1613558384730ab946/app/src/main/java/pers/zhc/tools/wubi) on Android.
I should've discovered librime earlier :)
